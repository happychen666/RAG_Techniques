# RAG Techniques Demonstration 🚀

This repository showcases various advanced techniques for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. RAG systems combine information retrieval with generative models to provide accurate and contextually rich responses. Explore the techniques below to enhance the performance and capabilities of your RAG systems.

## RAG Techniques

### Hierarchical Indices 🗂️
Creating a two-tiered system for document summaries and detailed chunks, both containing metadata pointing to the same location in the data.

### Hypothetical Questions (HyDE Approach) ❓
Generating hypothetical questions for better alignment between queries and data. Each question points to the relevant location in the data.

### Context Enrichment Techniques 📝
Embedding individual sentences and extending context to neighboring sentences. For example, retrieving the most relevant sentence while also accessing the sentences before and after it in the original text.

### Fusion Retrieval 🔍
Combining keyword-based search with vector-based search for optimized retrieval.

### Reranking 📊
Applying additional scoring mechanisms to the initially retrieved results to determine their relevance more accurately. This can be done using various models, including:
- **LLM-based Scoring:** Using a language model to score the relevance of each retrieved chunk.
- **Cross-Encoder Models:** Re-encoding both the query and the retrieved documents jointly to produce a similarity score.
- **Metadata Scoring:** Incorporating metadata such as recency, author credibility, or document type into the scoring process.

### Filtering 🛠️
- **Metadata Filtering:** Applying filters based on metadata attributes such as date, source, author, or document type. For instance, filtering out older documents if recency is crucial for the query.
- **Similarity Thresholds:** Setting thresholds for the relevance scores. Only results that meet or exceed a certain similarity score are kept for further processing.
- **Content Filtering:** Removing results that do not match specific content criteria. For example, filtering out results that do not contain certain keywords or phrases essential for answering the query accurately.
- **Diversity Filtering:** Ensuring diversity in the results by filtering out near-duplicate entries, thus providing a broad spectrum of relevant information without redundancy.

## Query Transformations 🔄

### Sub-query Decomposition 🧩
Breaking complex queries into simpler sub-queries.

### Step-back Prompting 🔁
Generating broader queries for better context retrieval.

### Query Rewriting ✍️
Reformulating queries to improve retrieval.

## Reference Citations 📜
Ensuring source accuracy using direct source mentions and fuzzy matching techniques.

## Knowledge Graph Integration 🌐

### Overview
Integrating knowledge graphs with RAG systems to provide structured data and relationships that can enrich the context.

### Implementation
- Retrieving entities and their relationships from a knowledge graph relevant to the query.
- Combining this structured data with the unstructured text retrieved by the RAG system to provide a more informative response.

## Retrieval with Feedback Loops 🔄

### Overview
Implementing feedback mechanisms where the system can learn from user interactions to improve future retrievals.

### Implementation
- Collecting user feedback on the relevance and quality of the retrieved documents and generated responses.
- Using this feedback to fine-tune the retrieval and ranking models.

## Adaptive Retrieval 🎯

### Overview
Dynamically adjusting retrieval strategies based on the type of query or the user’s context.

### Implementation
- Classifying queries into different categories (e.g., factual, opinion-based) and using specific retrieval strategies tailored to each category.
- Considering user context, such as previous interactions or preferences, to refine the retrieval process.

## Multi-modal Retrieval 🎥

### Overview
Extending RAG systems to handle multiple types of data, such as text, images, and videos, to provide richer responses.

### Implementation
- Integrating models that can retrieve and understand different data modalities.
- Combining insights from text, images, and videos to generate comprehensive responses.

## Iterative Retrieval 🔄

### Overview
Performing multiple rounds of retrieval, using the information from previous rounds to refine subsequent queries.

### Implementation
After an initial retrieval, using the LLM to analyze the results and generate follow-up queries to fill in gaps or clarify information.

## Ensemble Retrieval 🧠

### Overview
Using multiple retrieval models or techniques and combining their results.

### Implementation
Applying different embedding models or retrieval algorithms and using voting or weighting mechanisms to determine the final set of retrieved documents.

## Semantic Chunking 🧩

### Overview
Instead of splitting documents into fixed-size chunks, dividing them based on semantic coherence.

### Implementation
Using NLP techniques to identify topic boundaries or coherent sections within documents for more meaningful retrieval units.

## Dynamic Chunk Sizing 📏

- Adjusting the size of text chunks based on the complexity or importance of the content, rather than using a fixed chunk size.
- This helps preserve context in complex sections while reducing redundancy in simpler parts.

## Contextual Compression 📉

- After initial retrieval, using an LLM to compress or summarize the retrieved chunks while preserving key information relevant to the query.
- This allows for including more diverse information within the context window.

## Explainable Retrieval 🧐

- Providing transparency in the retrieval process by explaining why certain pieces of information were retrieved and how they relate to the query.
- Enhancing user trust and providing opportunities for system refinement.
