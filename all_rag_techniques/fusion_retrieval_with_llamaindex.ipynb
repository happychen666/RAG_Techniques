    "# Fusion Retrieval in Document Search\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This code implements a Fusion Retrieval system that combines vector-based similarity search with keyword-based BM25 retrieval. The approach aims to leverage the strengths of both methods to improve the overall quality and relevance of document retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional retrieval methods often rely on either semantic understanding (vector-based) or keyword matching (BM25). Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses. Fusion retrieval aims to combine these methods to create a more robust and accurate retrieval system that can handle a wider range of queries effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. PDF processing and text chunking\n",
    "2. Vector store creation using FAISS and OpenAI embeddings\n",
    "3. BM25 index creation for keyword-based retrieval\n",
    "4. Fusioning BM25 and vector search results for better retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The PDF is loaded and split into chunks using SentenceSplitter.\n",
    "2. Chunks are cleaned by replacing 't' with spaces (likely addressing a specific formatting issue).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Store Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. OpenAI embeddings are used to create vector representations of the text chunks.\n",
    "2. A FAISS vector store is created from these embeddings for efficient similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BM25 Index Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A BM25 index is created from the same text chunks used for the vector store.\n",
    "2. This allows for keyword-based retrieval alongside the vector-based method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Fusion Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "After creation of both indexes Query Fusion Retrieval combines them to enable a hybrid retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of this Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved Retrieval Quality: By combining semantic and keyword-based search, the system can capture both conceptual similarity and exact keyword matches.\n",
    "2. Flexibility: The `retriever_weights` parameter allows for adjusting the balance between vector and keyword search based on specific use cases or query types.\n",
    "3. Robustness: The combined approach can handle a wider range of queries effectively, mitigating weaknesses of individual methods.\n",
    "4. Customizability: The system can be easily adapted to use different vector stores or keyword-based retrieval methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Fusion retrieval represents a powerful approach to document search that combines the strengths of semantic understanding and keyword matching. By leveraging both vector-based and BM25 retrieval methods, it offers a more comprehensive and flexible solution for information retrieval tasks. This approach has potential applications in various fields where both conceptual similarity and keyword relevance are important, such as academic research, legal document search, or general-purpose search engines."

      "Node Content: Ruminant animals, such as cows and sheep, produce methane during digestion. Manure management practices also contribute to methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Innovations in livestock feeding and waste management can help mitigate these emissions.  Rice Cultivation  Flooded rice paddies create anaerobic conditions that lead to methane production. Improved water management and rice varieties can help reduce these emissions. Research into sustainable rice farming practices is crucial for balancing food security and clim ate goals.  Fertilizers  The use of synthetic fertilizers in agriculture releases nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. Practices such as precision farming and organic fertilizers can mitigate these emissions. The development of eco -friendly fertilizers and farming techniques is  essential for reducing the agricultural sector's carbon footprint.  Chapter 3: Effects of Climate Change  The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world and are projected to intensify in the coming decades. These effects include:  Rising Temperatures  Global temperatures have risen by about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 19th century. This warming is not uniform, with some regions experiencing more significant increases than others.  Heatwaves  Heatwaves are becoming more frequent and severe, posing risks to human health, agriculture, and infrastructure. Cities are particularly vulnerable due to the \"urban heat island\" effect. Heatwaves can lead to heat -related illnesses and exacerbate existing h ealth conditions.  Changing Seasons  Climate change is altering the timing and length of seasons, affecting ecosystems and human activities. For example, spring is arriving earlier, and winters are becoming shorter and milder in many regions. This shift disrupts plant and animal life cycles a nd agricultural practices.  Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels  Warmer temperatures are causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt, contributing to rising sea levels. Sea levels have risen by about 20 centimeters (8 inches) in the past century, threatening coastal communities and ecosystems.  Polar Ice Melt\n",

      "Node Content: Community -based solutions leverage local knowledge and resources to address climate challenges. Examples include community -led renewable energy projects, urban gardening, and local conservation efforts. Empowering communities to develop and implement their  own solutions fosters ownership and sustainability.  Innovative Financing Models  New financing models are emerging to support climate action and sustainable development. Examples include green bonds, impact investing, and crowdfunding. These models mobilize private capital for public goods and enable innovative projects to scale. Ensur ing financial inclusion and access to capital is crucial for widespread impact.  Governance Innovation  Adaptive Governance  Adaptive governance involves flexible and responsive decision -making processes that can adjust to changing conditions and new information.

These platforms provide spaces for sharing knowledge, building partnerships, and developing joint initiatives. Digital tools and online networks  are increasingly used to support collaborative governance.  Chapter 21: Climate Change and Cultural Shifts  Changing Cultural Narratives  Climate Stories  Storytelling is a powerful tool for changing cultural narratives around climate change.
